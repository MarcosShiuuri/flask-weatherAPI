Python web app using Flask and OpenWeatherAPI
This project displays info about the weather of a chosen city.

The goal was to improve my knowledge of APIs using Flask as the backend and OpenWeatherAPI from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) as the API.

Also, it uses basic HTML5 and CSS3 as the frontend, since the focus was the backend

VERSION OF WHAT WAS USED:
	Python - v3.11.0
	Flask - v2.2.2
	OpenWeatherAPI 'Current weather' - v2.0
	HTML5 & CSS3
